# opengl

Attempting to learn opengl and how to setup a working environment with it.

This will be an iterative process and so it may have many folders as I continue to find ways to improve and add contents.

I will be choosing what I consider to be "key" stopping points instead of leveraging version control so I have points of reference when and where I may need them.
