# go experiment

This is a silly little repository I created for experimentation with go.

Since my work often spans many computers, I like having a shared resource, and public visibility might help others with similar questions about basic functionality.

I expect the collection of experiments will continue to grow into hundreds of nano-projects over the years to serve as proof-of-concepts for whatever I happen to be toying with.

_After all, why ask others when I can figure it out directly and gain the experience?_  That or I was too lazy to find/read the documentation for the answers (or unable to comprehend them) at the time (which may actually also have taken longer).
